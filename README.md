## Description
Searchify is a Chrome extension that supercharges your search capabilities, allowing you to search multiple websites simultaneously using a single query or multiple queries at once. Organize your favorite websites into custom collections and folders for easy access, and configure searches for different sites to fit your needs. You can also import and export bulk JSON files of your search configurations, making it simple to share, back up, or replicate your setup. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or someone who wants to optimize browsing, Searchify offers a fast, flexible, and efficient solution for multi-site and multi-query searches.
